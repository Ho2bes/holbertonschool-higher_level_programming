# Python - Test Driven Development (TDD)

This project focuses on **Test Driven Development (TDD)** in Python. In TDD, you write tests before writing the actual code. The process involves creating test cases for the functionality you want to implement, ensuring your code meets these specifications, and then iterating on both until the desired functionality is achieved.

## 📝 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to introduce the concept of **Test Driven Development (TDD)** in Python, a software development process where tests are written before the code. We will use **unit tests** to define the functionality of our code, ensuring that all components behave as expected.

### Key Concepts:
- **Test Driven Development (TDD)**: A software development approach where you write tests before writing the actual code.
- **Unit Testing**: Testing individual units or components of a software to ensure correctness.
- **Edge Cases**: Handling and testing for unexpected input or situations that might cause failures.
- **Refactoring**: Improving code without changing its external behavior, often after writing tests.
- **Assertions**: Statements that test if a condition is true or false within unit tests.

### Skills Gained:
- Writing unit tests using Python's `unittest` framework.
- Following the TDD cycle: **Red (failing test)** -> **Green (passing test)** -> **Refactor**.
- Identifying and covering edge cases in your test cases.
- Refactoring code to improve its quality while ensuring the tests continue to pass.
