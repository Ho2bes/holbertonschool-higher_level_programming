# Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary

This repository contains solutions for the **Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary** project. This project focuses on using more advanced data structures in Python, specifically sets and dictionaries, as well as understanding how to utilize higher-order functions such as `lambda`, `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`.

## üìù Project Overview

In this project, you will explore the use of **sets** and **dictionaries** in Python, learning how they differ from lists and when to use each structure. You will also dive into higher-order functions and how they can help simplify and optimize operations. By the end of the project, you will be familiar with various set and dictionary operations and the utility of lambda functions and functions like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`.

### Key Concepts:
- **Sets**: Understand how to create and manipulate sets in Python, including adding and removing elements, performing set operations (e.g., union, intersection), and knowing when to use sets over lists.
- **Dictionaries**: Learn how to create and manipulate dictionaries, perform operations like adding/removing key-value pairs, and iterate over keys and values.
- **Lambda Functions**: Explore anonymous functions (lambdas) and their usage in combination with functions like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`.
- **Higher-Order Functions**: Use built-in Python functions (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`) to manipulate data structures in a concise way.

### Skills Gained:
- Creating and working with sets and dictionaries in Python.
- Performing common set operations like union, intersection, and difference.
- Manipulating dictionaries by adding, removing, and updating key-value pairs.
- Using lambda functions to simplify code.
- Leveraging `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` to perform efficient data processing.
