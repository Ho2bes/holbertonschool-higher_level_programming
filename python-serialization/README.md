# Python - Serialization

In this project, we explore **serialization** and **marshaling**, two essential concepts for efficiently handling and transferring data between different systems or components of an application. You'll learn how to transform complex Python objects into formats like JSON, CSV, and XML, and how to use Python's built-in tools for serialization and deserialization.

## üìù Project Overview

Serialization and marshaling enable the storage and transmission of Python objects in various formats, ensuring that data can be easily saved, transmitted, or shared between systems. In this project, we will work with multiple formats such as **JSON**, **pickle**, **CSV**, and **XML** to explore the different techniques for serializing and deserializing data.

### Key Concepts:
- **Marshaling**: Transforming memory objects into a standard format that can be transmitted or stored.
- **Serialization**: Converting Python objects into a format (like JSON or XML) that can be saved or transmitted.
- **Deserialization**: Converting serialized data back into its original object form.
- **Formats**: JSON, CSV, XML, and binary formats such as `pickle`.

### Skills Gained:
- Understanding the differences and similarities between marshaling and serialization.
- Implementing serialization in Python with different formats.
- Converting data between different representations (e.g., CSV to JSON, or Python objects to XML).
- Using Python's `pickle` module to serialize custom objects.

## üîß Setup Instructions

To run the code for this project, make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system. The modules used in this project are part of Python‚Äôs standard library, so no external libraries need to be installed.

## üìÇ Project Structure and Tasks

### 0. Basic Serialization (JSON)
- **File**: `task_00_basic_serialization.py`
- **Description**: This task involves writing two functions to serialize and deserialize a Python dictionary to and from a JSON file.
    - `serialize_and_save_to_file(data, filename)`: Serializes a Python dictionary and saves it as a JSON file.
    - `load_and_deserialize(filename)`: Loads a JSON file and deserializes it back into a Python dictionary.

### 1. Pickling Custom Classes
- **File**: `task_01_pickle.py`
- **Description**: Learn how to serialize and deserialize custom Python objects using the `pickle` module.
    - **Class**: `CustomObject` with attributes `name`, `age`, and `is_student`.
    - **Methods**:
      - `serialize(self, filename)`: Serializes the instance of `CustomObject` and saves it to a file.
      - `deserialize(cls, filename)`: Deserializes a `CustomObject` instance from a file using `pickle`.

### 2. Converting CSV Data to JSON
- **File**: `task_02_csv.py`
- **Description**: Convert data from CSV format to JSON format.
    - **Function**: `convert_csv_to_json(csv_filename)`
    - **Process**:
      - Reads data from a CSV file using Python‚Äôs `csv` module.
      - Serializes the data as JSON and writes it to `data.json`.

### 3. Serializing and Deserializing with XML
- **File**: `task_03_xml.py`
- **Description**: Serialize and deserialize Python dictionaries using XML.
    - **Functions**:
      - `serialize_to_xml(dictionary, filename)`: Serializes a Python dictionary into XML and writes it to a file.
      - `deserialize_from_xml(filename)`: Reads XML data from a file and deserializes it back into a Python dictionary.
