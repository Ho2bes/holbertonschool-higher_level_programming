# Holberton School - Higher Level Programming

Welcome to the **Higher Level Programming** repository for Holberton School! This project covers various programming languages and concepts, with a primary focus on **Python**, **SQL**, and **web development**. It builds on foundational knowledge to dive deeper into more advanced programming concepts, emphasizing writing efficient, scalable, and maintainable code.

## üìö Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will have learned to:

- **Python Programming**:
  - Use advanced Python features (e.g., classes, inheritance, and decorators).
  - Work with Python‚Äôs built-in data structures and algorithms.
  - Implement test-driven development (TDD) using `unittest`.
  - Handle files and perform file I/O operations.
  - Work with Python libraries for networking, serialization, and data persistence.

- **SQL**:
  - Write basic and advanced SQL queries.
  - Understand database concepts such as normalization, transactions, and relationships.
  - Use MySQL for data manipulation, querying, and optimization.

- **Web Development**:
  - Understand how to create RESTful APIs.
  - Build server-side web applications using frameworks like Flask.
  - Learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for front-end web development.
  - Use JavaScript libraries like jQuery to interact with APIs and manage DOM manipulation.

## üìÇ Project Structure

Here is an overview of the main projects included in this repository:

### Python Projects
1. **Python Basics**:
   - Variables, data types, control flow.
   - Functions, loops, and conditions.
   - Data structures (lists, dictionaries, sets, tuples).

2. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**:
   - Classes and objects.
   - Inheritance and polymorphism.
   - Abstract classes and interfaces.

3. **Python Exceptions and Testing**:
   - Writing robust code using exception handling.
   - Implementing test cases using `unittest`.
   
4. **Python File I/O**:
   - Reading from and writing to files.
   - Handling file permissions, file operations, and serialization (JSON, CSV).

5. **Python Networking**:
   - Using Python‚Äôs built-in libraries to send HTTP requests.
   - Building a simple web scraper.

### SQL Projects
1. **SQL Basics**:
   - Introduction to relational databases.
   - CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) with SQL.
   - Filtering, sorting, and joining tables.

2. **Advanced SQL**:
   - Using aggregate functions (e.g., `SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`).
   - Subqueries and complex joins.
   - Normalization, indexes, and optimizing queries.

### Web Development Projects
1. **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**:
   - Building static websites using HTML and CSS.
   - Writing basic JavaScript to interact with the DOM.
   - Introduction to AJAX for asynchronous communication with APIs.

2. **Flask Web Applications**:
   - Building dynamic web applications using Flask.
   - Implementing routing, templates, and forms.
   - Connecting Flask apps to a MySQL database.

3. **RESTful API Development**:
   - Building and consuming RESTful APIs.
   - API authentication and authorization.
   - Documenting APIs using OpenAPI/Swagger.
