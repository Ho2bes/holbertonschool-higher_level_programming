# Python - Object-relational Mapping (ORM)

In this project, we link two powerful worlds: **Databases** and **Python**! You will start by using the `MySQLdb` module to connect to a MySQL database and execute SQL queries. Later, you'll transition to using `SQLAlchemy`, an Object Relational Mapper (ORM), which abstracts the database interactions into Python objects, eliminating the need to write raw SQL queries directly.

## üìù Project Overview

### Key Concepts:
- **MySQLdb**: A Python module that allows you to connect to and interact with MySQL databases through SQL queries.
- **SQLAlchemy**: An ORM library that maps Python objects to database tables, enabling object-oriented interaction with databases.
- **ORM (Object Relational Mapping)**: A programming technique that links Python classes and objects to database tables without writing raw SQL.

### Skills Gained:
- Connecting to MySQL databases from Python using `MySQLdb`.
- Writing and executing SQL queries in Python.
- Understanding how to securely handle user input to prevent SQL injection.
- Mapping Python classes to database tables using SQLAlchemy.
- Performing database CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using both raw SQL and ORM.
