# Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary

This repository contains the solutions for the **Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary** project. The project focuses on advanced data structures in Python, particularly sets and dictionaries, and explores higher-order functions such as `lambda`, `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`. You will also learn about how to manipulate these data structures efficiently for common tasks.

## üìù Project Overview

In this project, you'll work with sets and dictionaries to handle unique data structures that offer significant advantages over lists for certain operations. Additionally, you'll explore lambda functions, as well as `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`, to simplify complex operations with functional programming techniques.

### Key Concepts:
- **Sets**: Unordered collections of unique elements. Sets provide fast membership testing and support operations like union, intersection, and difference.
- **Dictionaries**: Collections of key-value pairs, allowing efficient retrieval and updates of values associated with specific keys.
- **Lambda Functions**: Anonymous functions, often used in combination with `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()` for concise operations on iterables.
- **Higher-Order Functions**: Functions like `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()` that apply other functions to sequences of data.

### Skills Gained:
- Working with sets to manage collections of unique items.
- Using dictionaries to store and retrieve data via key-value pairs.
- Implementing operations on sets and dictionaries, such as searching, updating, and deleting elements.
- Utilizing lambda functions to create quick, inline functions.
- Applying functional programming concepts with `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`.
