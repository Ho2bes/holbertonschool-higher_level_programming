# Python - Import & Modules Project

This repository contains the solutions for the **Python Import & Modules** project. The project focuses on manipulating lists, tuples, and sequences in Python. Additionally, the project introduces common list operations, such as replacing elements, reversing lists, working with matrices, and managing tuple operations.

## üìù Project Overview

This project covers the fundamentals of **lists**, **tuples**, and **sequences** in Python. You will learn how to manipulate and work with lists, understand list comprehensions, manage list and tuple operations, and use Python's built-in methods to implement various functionalities. The exercises also explore tuple packing, sequence unpacking, and deleting elements using Python's `del` statement.

### Key Concepts:
- **Lists**: Understanding Python lists, their common methods, and how to use lists as stacks and queues.
- **Tuples**: Learning about tuples, when to use them, and how they differ from lists.
- **Sequence Operations**: Implementing tuple packing, sequence unpacking, and list comprehensions.
- **List Comprehensions**: A concise way to create lists from sequences using a single line of code.
- **Element Access**: Learning how to safely access and replace elements in lists and sequences.

### Skills Gained:
- Managing and manipulating Python lists and tuples.
- Understanding and applying list comprehensions.
- Using the `del` statement to remove elements from lists.
- Handling tuple operations and managing tuple addition.
- Writing functions to manipulate and interact with lists and tuples.
