# Python - Everything is Object Project

This repository contains the solutions for the **Python - Everything is Object** project. The project focuses on how Python handles objects, references, and mutability, helping you understand how Python manages different types of objects and how these concepts influence Python's behavior.

## üìù Project Overview

In this project, you'll explore how Python handles object identity, mutability, and immutability. Through a series of questions and tasks, you'll understand how objects are referenced in memory, how Python treats mutable and immutable objects, and how these properties affect how data is passed between variables and functions. This project will deepen your understanding of Python's internal mechanics, which is essential for writing efficient and bug-free code.

### Key Concepts:
- **Objects and References**: Understand how objects are stored in memory and how references work in Python.
- **Mutability vs Immutability**: Learn the difference between mutable and immutable types and how this impacts variable behavior.
- **Function Arguments**: Discover how Python passes arguments to functions (by reference or by value) and the implications for mutable and immutable objects.
- **Identity and Equality**: Differentiate between `is` (identity) and `==` (equality) when comparing objects.
- **Memory Management**: Explore how Python handles memory allocation and reference counting for objects.

### Skills Gained:
- Identifying and managing object references in Python.
- Understanding how mutability and immutability affect program behavior.
- Correctly passing arguments to functions, considering the mutability of objects.
- Using the `id()`, `type()`, and `is` operators to analyze object behavior.
- Understanding tuple packing, sequence unpacking, and object identity in memory.
