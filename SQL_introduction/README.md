# SQL Introduction Project

This repository contains solutions for the **SQL Introduction** project at Holberton School. The project introduces the fundamental concepts of **SQL (Structured Query Language)** and relational databases. You'll learn how to create, manage, and query databases using SQL commands.

## üìù Project Overview

SQL is the standard language for interacting with relational databases. In this project, you'll explore the basics of SQL, including how to create tables, insert data, and retrieve information from a database. This project will also introduce SQL queries like `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, and how to filter and sort data using SQL clauses.

### Key Concepts:
- **Databases**: Understanding relational databases and how data is structured in tables.
- **SQL Commands**: Learning basic SQL queries to interact with a database.
- **CRUD Operations**: Performing Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on database tables.
- **Joins**: Combining data from multiple tables using SQL joins.
- **Constraints**: Implementing constraints such as primary keys, foreign keys, and unique constraints.

### Skills Gained:
- Writing SQL queries to create and manage database schemas.
- Inserting, updating, and deleting records in a relational database.
- Querying data from multiple tables using joins.
- Applying constraints to ensure data integrity within the database.
