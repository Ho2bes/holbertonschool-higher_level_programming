# Python - Classes and Objects Project

This repository contains the solutions for the **Python Classes and Objects** project. The project introduces the core concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python, focusing on the creation and manipulation of classes and objects. By working through these tasks, you will gain a strong understanding of OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and object interactions.

## üìù Project Overview

This project focuses on the fundamental concepts of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Python. You will learn how to create classes, manage objects and instances, and utilize various OOP techniques such as encapsulation and getters/setters. The goal of the project is to give you hands-on experience in defining and manipulating objects, as well as understanding their attributes and methods.

### Key Concepts:
- **Classes and Objects**: Understanding the difference between classes (blueprints) and objects (instances).
- **Attributes**: Defining and managing object data through public, private, and protected attributes.
- **Methods**: Implementing behaviors associated with classes and objects using methods.
- **Encapsulation**: Hiding internal details and exposing a clean public interface.
- **`__init__` Method**: The constructor method used to initialize new objects.
- **Properties**: Using Python properties to manage access to attributes (getter and setter methods).
- **Dynamically Adding Attributes**: Learning how to dynamically add new attributes to class instances.

### Skills Gained:
- Understanding the basics of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
- Defining and instantiating classes and objects.
- Managing private and public attributes.
- Writing getter and setter methods to safely access and update private attributes.
- Using the special `__init__` method to initialize object states.
- Implementing object behaviors through methods.
- Dynamically modifying objects by adding new attributes.

## üìÇ Project Structure

- **0-square.py**: Defines an empty class `Square` that represents a square.
- **1-square.py**: Defines a `Square` class with a private attribute `size`, allowing instantiation with a specified size.
- **2-square.py**: Extends the `Square` class by adding size validation (size must be an integer greater than or equal to 0).
- **3-square.py**: Adds a method `area()` to calculate the area of the square.
- **4-square.py**: Implements getter and setter methods for the private attribute `size`.
- **5-square.py**: Adds a `my_print()` method to print the square using the character `#`.
- **6-square.py**: Extends the `Square` class by adding a private attribute `position`, which defines the position of the square when printing it.
