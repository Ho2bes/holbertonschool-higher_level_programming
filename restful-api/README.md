# Python - RESTful API Development

Welcome to the **RESTful API Development** project. In this project, we explore the fundamental principles of RESTful APIs, understanding how they work, how to consume and develop them, and how to secure them. REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style that is widely used for building scalable and efficient web services.

## 📚 Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to:
1. **Understand HTTP/HTTPS Basics**: Learn how data transfer happens over HTTP and HTTPS, and understand the differences between the two protocols.
2. **Consume APIs using Command Line Tools**: Use tools like `curl` to interact with APIs and retrieve data.
3. **Consume APIs with Python**: Use Python libraries like `requests` to fetch and process data from APIs.
4. **Develop APIs using `http.server`**: Create a simple API using Python’s built-in modules.
5. **Develop APIs using Flask**: Build more complex APIs with Flask, a lightweight web framework for Python.
6. **Secure APIs with Authentication**: Learn about common security practices, including API keys, OAuth, and JWT.
7. **Document APIs with OpenAPI**: Ensure your APIs are easy to use and maintain by documenting them with OpenAPI standards.

## 🔍 Importance

In today's interconnected world, APIs serve as the backbone of modern applications by allowing different systems to communicate with one another. Whether it's social media platforms, payment systems, or IoT devices, RESTful APIs enable seamless data exchange. By mastering RESTful API development, you'll gain valuable skills to build, consume, and secure web services that can be integrated into various applications.

### Components of a RESTful API:
1. **Client**: The user or application making requests to the API. This could be a web browser, a mobile app, or a command-line tool.
2. **Web Server**: The server that receives the incoming HTTP requests from clients and routes them to the appropriate API endpoints.
3. **API Server**: The server responsible for processing API requests, handling business logic, and interacting with the database or other services.
4. **Database**: The storage system that holds the data which the API retrieves or modifies.

### Flow:
1. The **client** sends an HTTP/HTTPS request to the **web server**.
2. The **web server** routes the request to the appropriate **API server**.
3. The **API server** processes the request and interacts with the **database** if necessary.
4. The **API server** returns a response to the **web server**.
5. The **web server** sends the response back to the **client**.
