# JavaScript DOM Manipulation Project

This repository contains solutions for the **JavaScript DOM Manipulation** project. The project focuses on learning how to interact with and manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) using JavaScript to create dynamic and interactive web pages.

## üìù Project Overview

The **Document Object Model (DOM)** is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents the structure of a document as a tree of objects, allowing developers to manipulate elements, attributes, and content using JavaScript. This project covers various techniques for DOM manipulation, including selecting elements, modifying content, handling events, and dynamically creating and removing elements.

### Key Concepts:
- **DOM Selection**: Using JavaScript to select and interact with elements on the web page.
- **Event Handling**: Attaching event listeners to elements to respond to user actions such as clicks, input, and form submissions.
- **Element Creation and Deletion**: Dynamically creating, modifying, and removing HTML elements from the DOM.
- **CSS Manipulation**: Modifying the styles of elements using JavaScript.
- **Traversing the DOM**: Navigating between parent, child, and sibling elements in the DOM structure.

### Skills Gained:
- Selecting and manipulating HTML elements using JavaScript methods such as `getElementById()`, `querySelector()`, and `querySelectorAll()`.
- Handling events like clicks, keypresses, and form submissions using `addEventListener()`.
- Dynamically creating, updating, and removing HTML elements using `createElement()`, `appendChild()`, and `remove()`.
- Changing the appearance of elements by modifying inline styles and classes.
- Traversing the DOM to access related elements in the document hierarchy.
