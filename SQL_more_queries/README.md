# SQL More Queries Project

This repository contains solutions for the **SQL More Queries** project at Holberton School. This project builds upon the basics of SQL, diving deeper into more advanced queries and database management concepts, including user management, privileges, and advanced SQL operations like joins, unions, and subqueries.

## üìù Project Overview

In this project, you'll explore more advanced SQL concepts that are crucial for managing and interacting with databases in real-world applications. The focus is on user management, advanced filtering, combining data from multiple tables, and performing complex operations on relational databases using SQL.

### Key Concepts:
- **User Management**: Creating and managing database users and their privileges.
- **Joins**: Combining rows from two or more tables based on related columns.
- **Subqueries**: Using queries within queries to fetch data based on complex conditions.
- **UNION**: Combining results from multiple `SELECT` queries into a single result set.
- **Indexes**: Creating indexes to optimize query performance.

### Skills Gained:
- Managing database users and privileges.
- Writing complex queries that combine data from multiple tables.
- Understanding and implementing subqueries to handle advanced queries.
- Using indexes to speed up query performance on large datasets.
